# Attendance-System-Using-Face-Recognition

# Project Abstract
Face recognition technology has become widely used in many areas, such as security, surveillance, and human-computer interaction. 
In this project, we introduce a face recognition attendance system created using OpenCV and Python. The system's goal is to 
automate attendance tracking by recognizing faces captured through a camera. OpenCV is a free computer vision library,
that can be used to handle tasks like face detection, feature extraction, and recognition. The system uses a pre-trained
deep learning model for face recognition and applies techniques like face embedding and similarity comparison to achieve 
accurate identification. It offers real-time face detection, recognition, and attendance logging features, making it a
convenient solution for attendance management in schools and businesses. The system is tested and verified using various 
experiments which shows that it accurately identifies individuals and record their attendance.
